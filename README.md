# Responsive Web Design Test Bed

A test bed for testing a locally hosted project using multiple form factors on
a single web page.

## Usage

First of all, run the project you want to test on `localhost` using port `8080`.
Then, to run the test bed, navigate to the root directory and run the `http-server` node
module using:

```bash
$ http-server -p [chosen-port]
```

Finally, navigate to the test bed by typing into the browser:

```
http://localhost:[chosen-port]
```
